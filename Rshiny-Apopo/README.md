## Features and Purpose

## Getting Started:

## Data Update Instructions:

The application currently processes the data from the `TBdetectionRats_Tanzania.xlsx` file. If you have an updated version of the data and wish to run the application on this new dataset without changing the structure of the data frame in the application, follow these steps:

1. Replace the existing `TBdetectionRats_Tanzania.xlsx` file in the designated directory with your new `.xlsx` file. **Ensure the new file is named exactly as `TBdetectionRats_Tanzania.xlsx`** and the structure of the data is identical to the one in the original file.

2. The file path for the `.xlsx` file is mentioned in lines 369 and 370 of the `app.R` script. If your updated file is stored in a different directory, modify this file path accordingly.

## Usage Instructions:
- Provide a brief guide on how to interact with the app.
